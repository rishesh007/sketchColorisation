# SKETCH COLORISATION

Sketch or line art colorization is a research field with significant market demand. Different from photo colorization which strongly relies on texture information, sketch colorization is more challenging as sketches may not have texture. Even worse, color, texture, and gradient have to be generated from the abstract sketch lines. In this project, we propose a learning-based framework to colorize sketches with proper color, texture as well as the gradient.
